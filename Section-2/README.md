#Section 2
##Gravity / Diameter coin separator

Sitting on top of [Section 3](../Section-3/README.md) will be the coin seperator.

While quite hard to explain in words, it's quite simple the way it works:

1. Coin is dropped on the taller side of an inclined plan.
2. The top surface of the inclined plan is not the thickness of a single coin.  
   Rather, it's the sum of the thicknesses of the possible coins one wants to sort.  
   The reason for this is that the back wall, 90 degres to the top surface of the inclined plane, is shaped as a wave.  
   This wave is involved in the diameter sorting of the coins.  
   The smallest coin get's sorted first, and falls into it's alloted shute, through a vertical slot.  
   This slot is shaped in a way that it prevents bigger coins to get stuck and allows it to continue to the next diameter selection.
3. Each slot will then have a path towards the left or the right, guiding it to a different whimsical area in [Section 3](../Section-3/README.md).
