#Section 1
##Crank operated lift

This is the place where you put your coin and wind the mechanism.

The immediate action is to get the inserted coin up to [Section 2](../Section-2/README.md).

It can also be used to store energy in rubber bands or springs to be used in the future.

The crank will pull a counter-weight inside a tight fit tube, closed at the bottom end.  
The counter-weight will have grooves that allow, controlled, air flow, decreasing it's speed going down.  
This will allow the lift to reset without putting too much force into it's components.  
It will also prevent the crank from hurting the operator.
